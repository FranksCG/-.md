【The engineering firm's warning was clear: without corresponding training, the existing employees would be missing the experience necessary to keep up with new findings and technologies. The company was willing to invest in their earnings, but only if they were willing to invest in themselves. A culture of continuous learning and improvement was necessary for success in such a rapidly changing industry. Those who were open to learning and embracing new challenges found that their earnings and opportunities grew in proportion to their efforts. However, those who were resistant to change found themselves falling behind, their skills becoming outdated and irrelevant. The finding was clear - in this industry, complacency was not an option.
